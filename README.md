## legacy-lands-library

This is a project that aims to encapsulate various existing libraries to facilitate the team to develop Folia plug-ins.

The overall dependence is on the Fairy Framework framework. It probably doesn't have a lot of overly complex stuff, like an unnecessary repackaging of some large library.
