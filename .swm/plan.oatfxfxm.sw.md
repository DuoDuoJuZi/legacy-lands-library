title: Plan

At present, the annotation and configuration modules provide relatively basic services, and it is not yet clear what needs to be supplemented.

Mongodb relies on morphia to provide relatively complete services, but its first-level and second-level caches need to be provided by the cache module.

The data module should provide more complete content queries based on the mongodb and cache modules, which may be a relatively large project.

Security has not yet clarified what functions it will provide, but it may be certain that it should be inseparable from the permission group of folia, or there will be a new module responsible for it. What is certain is that disaster recovery and backup services will be completed by security.
